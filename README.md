# Card Swipe Fraud Insights

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and detection of fraudulent credit card transactions using various machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to identify and analyze patterns of fraudulent behavior in credit card transactions, and build predictive models that can help in early fraud detection.

## Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a growing problem, and identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial for financial security. In this project, we explore different machine learning models to predict fraudulent activities based on transactional data.

### Key Features:
- **Data Analysis:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and anomalies in transaction data.
- **Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature scaling, and dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- **Modeling:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.
- **Insights:** Key takeaways and insights from the analysis and modeling process.

## Files Included
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the step-by-step analysis and implementation of fraud detection models.
- `data/`: Sample dataset (if applicable, or specify a link to the dataset).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file containing details about the project.
